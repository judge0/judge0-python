Contributing
============

Preparing the development setup
-------------------------------

1. Install Python 3.9

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install python3.9 python3.9-venv

2. Clone the repo, create and activate a new virtual environment

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd judge0-python
    $ python3.9 -m venv venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate

3. Install the library and development dependencies

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -e .[test]
    $ pip install -r docs/requirements.txt # needed for building the docs
    $ pre-commit install

Building documentation
----------------------

Documentation is built using Sphinx. To build the documentation, run the

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd docs
    $ make html

You should inspect the changes in the documentation by opening the
``docs/build/html/index.html`` file in your browser.

You'll see a different output since the documentation is build with
`sphinx-multiversion <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/multiversion>`_ extension.

Testing
-------

.. warning::
    If you are implementing features or fixing bugs, you are expected to have
    all of the three API keys (ATD, Sulu, and RapidAPI) setup and set in you
    environment variables - ``JUDGE0_SULU_API_KEY``, ``JUDGE0_RAPID_API_KEY``,
    and ``JUDGE0_ATD_API_KEY``.

Every bug fix or new feature should have tests for it. The tests are located in
the ``tests`` directory and are written using `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/>`_.

While working with the tests, you should use the following fixtures:

* ``default_ce_client`` - a client, chosen based on the environment variables set, that uses the CE flavor of the client.
* ``default_extra_ce_client`` - a client, chosen based on the environment variables set, that uses the Extra CE flavor of the client.

The ``default_ce_client`` and ``default_extra_ce_client`` are fixtures that
return a client based on the environment variables set. This enables you to
run the full test suite locally, but also to run the tests on the CI pipeline
without changing the tests.

You can use the fixtures in your tests like this:

.. code-block:: python
    
    def test_my_test(request):
        client = request.getfixturevalue("default_ce_client") # or default_extra_ce_client

To run the tests locally, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pytest -svv tests -k '<test_name>'

This will enable you to run a single test, without incurring the cost of
running the full test suite. If you want to run the full test suite, you can
use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pytest -svv tests

or you can create a draft PR and let the CI pipeline run the tests for you.
The CI pipeline will run the tests on every PR, using a private instance
of Judge0, so you can be sure that your changes are not breaking the existing
functionality.
